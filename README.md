### Concept: 

A guide for cyclists and adventurers interested in venturing the Loire River by Bike route (Loire à Vélo) in the Loire Valley, France. It presents:

- An interactive map presenting the route, with offers for physical and digital app guides.
- French castles within reach of the route, their basic information and placement.
- List of restaurants to be found alongside the route with their basic information.
- List of repair and rental shops available along the route with their basic information. 


### Functionality: 

The user has access from the main page to a dynamic menu that leads to each service. A sticky nav bar is present throughout the site, as well as a footer with social media links and a contact form. The desktop screen version offers a weather forecast widget of the center of the zone.


### Design concept:

A theme of adventure and fun. A style that would bring to mind games: sleek and modern yet playful. The palette of coral-orange and teal blue seemed appropriate and reflected the light of a summer day as well as the blue of the Loire river.

### Tools used:

- Visual Studio Code
- Git Bash
- Bootstrap (navbar, Route Info guide cards, carousel, icons, container)
- [Forecast 7](https://forecast7.com/) (weather widget)
- [Geovelo](https://www.geovelo.fr/) (interactive map)
- Figma
- [Pixabay](http://pixabay.com) (images)
- [FlatIcon](http://flaticon.com) (icons)
- [Freepik](http://freepik.com) (icons)
- [All Free Photos](http://all-free-photos.com) (castle photos)


### Components:

The contact forms are not functional, and the restaurant, repair and rental shops are mockups, used for the purpose of displaying contents and coding skills.

The restaurant and repair/rental shop page cards are integrated through DOM manipulation so that a database could be created as a future feature, where an admin may log in and fill in new businesses' data to be added to the page automatically.

The castle page cards hover effects and onClick collapse menus were coded with JavaScript, as well as the pop-up contact form in the mobile version.

### Comments:

**Lorianne**: We were asked to build a basic website with CSS, HTML and JavaScript in 2 weeks. We didn't want to rely so much on Bootstrap, but code as much as time permitted, given we also had to follow our course (quests, etc.) during the a time-frame of 2 weeks, to get good practice. I wanted to practice DOM manipulation so I used it to create the cards in two of the pages. I also wanted to get better at using flexboxes and CSS through coding the card's structures and overall design. I'm happy with the outcome and though as they say, a website is never finished, I plan on leaving the project as is so we can look back at it after finishing the course and see our progress.
